# Cos-Aiko

The previous attempts at services with similar goals have ended up unmanaged, unliked, and unused. We aim to provide con-going artists, designers, speakers, business owners, and more, with a new, fluid, fun, secure, cutting edge mobile application.

Process models, system models, and other documentation to be added at a later date.
